Docker Action Staged Taint Analysis Utilizing Summaries and WIR
Description

Uses the fundamental ideologies established in the ARGUS taint analysis engine and expands it to Docker actions.
This is a standalone tool and does NOT work with ARGUS. Currently only works with select projects and is not tested
on industry-datasets. This is meant more as a proof-of-concept to show that it is possible to complete given enough resources
and time.

How to Use

    Make sure the repository is your current working directory.

    Run python ./src/main.py

    The output is located in the terminal and a file in the ./results/ folder

Currently supported docker types: 

    Local Dockerfiles (âœ“)
    Remote Docker Images (X)

Dataset

    As discussed in the presentation, there is not a reliable way to find datasets for Docker actions. As a result this tool
    was tested using hand-built workflows. This repository is set up to utilize one of these example workflows by default. If
    a user wants to test their own workflow they need to modify the filepath in the main python file.
