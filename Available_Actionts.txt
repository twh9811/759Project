Taint Source Criteria per Argus
"We consider taint sources as all the data associated with an event that can be completely controlled by the user triggering the event."

Taint Sink Criteria per Argus
"Our taint sinks involve all entities enabling command execution. In the case of workflows, we consider every run: statement as a sink, 
as they are used to construct a bash script. As for JavaScript, all functions capable of running arbitrary commands are classified as sinks."
