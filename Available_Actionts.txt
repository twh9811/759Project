Taint Source Criteria per Argus
"We consider taint sources as all the data associated with an event that can be completely controlled by the user triggering the event."

Taint Sink Criteria per Argus
"Our taint sinks involve all entities enabling command execution. In the case of workflows, we consider every run: statement as a sink, 
as they are used to construct a bash script. As for JavaScript, all functions capable of running arbitrary commands are classified as sinks."

Uses: Specify the action or workflow to execute in the steps
With: Provides input parameters to an action

Build and push Docker images - https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-and-push-docker-images

Potential Sinks:
add                 hosts - List of customs host-to-IP mapping (e.g., docker:10.180.0.1)
allow               List of extra privileged entitlement (e.g., network.host,security.insecure)
annotations 	    List of annotation to set to the image
build-args 	        List of build-time variables
build-contexts 	    List of additional build contexts (e.g., name=path)
cache-from 	        List of external cache sources (e.g., type=local,src=path/to/dir)
cache-to 	        List of cache export destinations (e.g., type=local,dest=path/to/dir)
context             Build's context is the set of files located in the specified PATH or URL (default Git context)
file        	    Path to the Dockerfile. (default {context}/Dockerfile)
labels              List of metadata for an image
network 	        Set the networking mode for the RUN instructions during build
platforms           List of target platforms for build
secrets 	        List of secrets to expose to the build (e.g., key=string, GIT_AUTH_TOKEN=mytoken)
secret-envs         List of secret env vars to expose to the build (e.g., key=envname, MY_SECRET=MY_ENV_VAR)
secret-files 	    List of secret files to expose to the build (e.g., key=filename, MY_SECRET=./secret.txt)
ssh 	            List of SSH agent socket or keys to expose to the build
tags                List of tags
target 	            Sets the target stage to build
github-token 	    GitHub Token used to authenticate against a repository for Git context (default ${{ github.token }})

Probably Not Sinks Based On Criteria Definition:
attests 	        List of attestation parameters (e.g., type=sbom,generator=image)
builder 	        Builder instance (see setup-buildx action)
cgroup-parent 	    Optional parent cgroup for the container used in the build
load 	            Load is a shorthand for --output=type=docker (default false)
no-cache    	    Do not use cache when building the image (default false)
no-cache-filters    Do not cache specified stages
outputs 	        List of output destinations (format: type=local,dest=path)
provenance 	        Generate provenance attestation for the build (shorthand for --attest=type=provenance)
pull 	            Always attempt to pull all referenced images (default false)
push 	            Push is a shorthand for --output=type=registry (default false)
sbom 	            Generate SBOM attestation for the build (shorthand for --attest=type=sbom)
ulimit 	            Ulimit options (e.g., nofile=1024:1024)
shm-size 	        Size of /dev/shm (e.g., 2g)
